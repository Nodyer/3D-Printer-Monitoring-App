# **3D Printer Monitoring App**
If you want to read it in portuguese (Brazil): (link)
Our project have as an objective create an App capable of monitoring a 3D printer movement and advise when it is done (out of movement). It comes in two modules, the main code with a server and the App. The communication is one-way only, just making sure the code send the printer current state. The code only use one library that is OpenCV and the server is easily achieved with a native module of python.

pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```

### Linux
 After downloading Python the user also gets Pip. 
```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
```
### **Android Ambient**
You will need an Android Ambient, it can be an Android Phone of any brand.

# **How to use it?**
 1. You need to setup a server of your choice or use the native module of python.
 2. Make a .json file with the information you want to communicate.
